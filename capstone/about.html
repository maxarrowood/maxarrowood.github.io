            <p>Hi, my name is Max Arrowood. I was born on October 7th, 2004 in Janesville, Wisconsin. My family consists of 5 memebers; my dad, my mom,
                an older sister, and a younger brother. I also have 2 pets, named Bucky and Bean. My hobbies consist of 
                playing sports, listening to music, and spending time with friends and family.

            <p>My educational journey began in Janesville, WI, where I attended Roosevelt Elementary and
                Edison Middle School. I was lucky enough to be given the opportunity to be a part of 
                the TAG Program, where I was able to accelerate my learning. I am currently attending Joseph 
                A Craig High School. I am currently a senior. I have been given the opportunity to take 
                many challenging and fun courses during my tenure here. I am excited to be taking my next steps 
                soon as I advance to University!
